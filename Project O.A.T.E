Preface
 Hello, below are my final and first drafts. I want to submit ideas about outer space DOTA and StarCraft. Those are the only two games I care about right now. And Outer space is the only area of life I care about. I care about English and game development in my college, but my college is fun the way it is. It could use events about game development like the established events associated with English.
 
 
First Draft
Luna Expatriation is the process of migrating to a moon around another planet to revolve around the sun as an inner planet. This process will take a lot of effort. It will take effort to make machines that can help the migration cycle possible. The solar system has twenty moons which can be isolated and transformed into planets in the inner solar system or moons of planets in the inner solar system. Venus still needs a sizable moon. Mars needs a bigger moon also. Imagine if we used thirty-four machines in the migration process.
 
 
Understanding Orbit Aerospace Terraforming Engineering

The Understanding and the Exploration of bodies in our solar system have always been at the forefront of scientific curiosity and Astronomy. In recent years, the concept of Extralunar migration—Orbit Aerospace Terraforming Engineering—has captured the imaginations of astronomers and space enthusiasts alike. O.A.T.E (Orbit Aerospace Terraforming Engineering Engineering) involves the ambitious endeavor of relocating moons from their current orbits around gas giants to revolve around the sun as inner planets. This article explores the intricacies of that process, the potential benefits, and the technological challenges it presents.
 
O.A.T.E. proposes the migration of large moons around gas giants, such as Jupiter and Saturn, to new orbits within the inner solar system. This process aims to transform these moons into planets or moons of inner planets, thereby altering the dynamics of our solar system.
 
Executing Luna Expatriation requires major effort and enhanced technological innovation. One crucial aspect involves the development of specialized machines capable of assisting in the migration process. These machines would need to possess the capability of transporting, navigation, orbital manipulation, and exerting gravitational forces on the celestial bodies.
 
The solar system boasts a diverse array of—around twenty—moons, each with unique characteristics and potential for transformation. With twenty moons available for O.A.T.E, and a playground of around one hundred seventy million kilometers, opportunities abound for reshaping the inner solar system, which means that moons can become moons of inner planets or evolve into inner planets themselves. For instance, Venus lacks a sizeable moon, making it a prime candidate for hosting a migrated moon. Similarly, mars could benefit from acquiring a larger moon to stabilize its axis and potentially make it habitable. Lastly, Ceres and Pluto could transform into habitable planets.
 
To initiate the O.A.T.E. process, thirty machines must be strategically deployed around the celestial body and throughout the solar system. These machines would serve as the driving force behind maneuvering the Extralunar Migration, orchestrating the movement of moons toward their new destinations. Through precise calculations and controlled maneuvers, these machines would detour the moons through space into their desired location.
 
Despite the ambitious vision of Orbit Aerospace Terraforming Engineering, numerous challenges and considerations must be addressed. Firstly, the sheer scale of the undertaking involved planning and coordination. Additionally, the gravitational interactions between moons, planets, and the sun pose complex dynamics that must be carefully explored to avoid unintended consequences. A final issue is that each moon's atmosphere might grow from the sun's heat. For example. With lakes of methane and Ethane, Saturn’s moon water is so dense, that it replicates the sensation of rocks on Earth, this dense water might evaporate and become larger when migrated closer to the sun.
 
Furthermore, O.A.T.E raises important questions regarding environmental and ethical considerations. The potential disruption to existing ecosystems on moons and planets, as well as the impact on indigenous life forms, must be thoroughly evaluated.  Additionally, ethical debates surrounding the manipulation of celestial bodies and the alteration of natural processes require careful examination. Also, the sheer volume of effects on computer systems will need to be considered.
 
The substantial scale of time that it will take to learn this technology will take approximately two millennia to accomplish properly. Keeping the next generation interested and possessing the original plan will take a lot of effort on humanity’s part. We only live a max of one hundred years so two thousand years will take a lot of effort.
 
While O.A.T.E. remains a speculative concept, its exploration sheds light on humanity’s boundless curiosity and ingenuity. As technological advancements continue to progress, the possibility of reshaping our solar system becomes increasingly feasible. Whether or not Orbit Aerospace Terraforming Engineering evolves into reality, the pursuit of knowledge and exploration will continue to drive scientific quests to understand the cosmos.
 
In Conclusion, Orbit Aerospace Terraforming Engineering represents a bold vision for the future of our solar system. By adding technology and innovation to humanity’s arsenal, we may one day witness the transformation of moons into planets, reshaping the dynamics of our cosmic neighborhood. While numerous challenges and considerations lie ahead, pursuing Extralunar migration underscores the relentless pursuit of knowledge and exploration by the scientific community in the vast expanse of space.
