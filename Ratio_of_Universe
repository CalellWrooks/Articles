Our universe is by far a really big deal. It is so big I don't know how to explain it to someone who is not in my area. 

God has gifted us with a large playground.

Boggle, Boggle is a game with an hourglass sold with each product. This hourglass has small grains of sand that keep track of time. 

I like to explain that a single grain of sand is the size of earth and that maryland is the size of our inner planets. Our galaxy is as big as the Pacific ocean while the grian of sand is still the size of the earth. 
The solar system is a ratio of the group of galaxies in this section of our nebula while the grain of sand is still the size of the earth.
